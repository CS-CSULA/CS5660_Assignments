## Lab

- Data Preparation

  Complete this lecture notebook on data preparation techniques.

- Intro to CBOW model

  You will get an introduction to the CBOW model, its activation functions and practice numpy along the way.

- Training the CBOW model

  In this lecture notebook you will be doing some hands-on exercises on topics such as: Forward propagation, Cross-entropy loss, Backpropagation and Gradient descent.

- Word Embeddings

  In this lecture notebook you will see how to get word embedding vectors from a trained model.

- Word embeddings step by step

  Practicing on small examples will prepare you for the graded assignment, where you will combine the techniques in more advanced ways to create word embeddings from a real-life corpus.
