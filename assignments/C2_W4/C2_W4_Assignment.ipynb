    "# Assignment 4: Word Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth (and last) programming assignment of Chapter 2! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice how to compute word embeddings and use them for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- To implement sentiment analysis, you can go beyond counting the number of positive words and negative words. \n",
    "- You can find a way to represent each word numerically, by a vector. \n",
    "- The vector could then represent syntactic (i.e. parts of speech) and semantic (i.e. meaning) structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore a classic way of generating word embeddings or representations.\n",
    "- You will implement a famous model called the continuous bag of words (CBOW) model. \n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train word vectors from scratch.\n",
    "- Learn how to create batches of data.\n",
    "- Understand how backpropagation works.\n",
    "- Plot and visualize your learned word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to train these models will give you a better understanding of word vectors, which are building blocks to many applications in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made."
