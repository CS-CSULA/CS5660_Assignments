# Final Project

As we get closer to the end of the semester, we'd like to have everyone start thinking about the final project. The final project is essentially the last assignment, so you don't have to start the technical part immediately (though of course, you can start whenever you'd like if you have the time!). However, we'd like to ensure you have the team, topic, and some understanding of what's been done for the problem and datasets you'd use so that you're ready once this period starts.

Here are some comments/guidelines/due dates:

## Teaming

- Project Proposal: We will create a discussion topic in canvas for everyone to submit their team information, topics, proposed approaches, etc. This will be required for the [project proposal](proposal.md).

- Teaming Channel:

  - If you have an idea and would like to create a team, please put potential topics/interests so that others can join your team.
  
  - If you'd like to introduce yourself to be picked up by a team, you can sell yourself on discord's teaming channel.
  
  - If you find a team or the team is full, please add a "green checking mark" to the thread to let others know.

## Project Ideas

- You can come up with any topic you'd like! Below are some suggestions if you are having trouble coming up with one (again you are not limited to them). I highly recommend watching interesting talks, reading papers, etc. to get ideas.

- I will be posted a couple of [project ideas](./ideas.md) so that you can pick one up among them if you/your team do not have any ideas.

## Rubrics

The [rubrics](rubrik.md) are along with the [LaTex template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qqcypvxzwpbx) for the report (you can use Word or something else, but please follow the format and structure and font/margins to make sure you don't miss something and make grading easier).

## Due Dates

- Project proposal: The project proposal will be due Week 12, Sunday, 11:59 PM. We will ask for a short proposal with the team, topic, and related work (papers/materials on the topic). None of it will be set in stone nor will you have to commit to what you propose exactly. The purpose is to give you feedback on feasibility, risk, and guidelines for success. Please do make use of it as it is important to make sure there aren't any obvious risks to the project.

- Final project: The final project will be due Week 17, Sunday 11:59 PM. There will be no extensions (the grading deadline is soon after).

## Reminder

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

We know teams are sometimes hard, but please make sure to respect your teammates and put significant effort into it, as if it was an individual assignment. We expect *everyone* in the team to participate actively, and you should probably be meeting/communicating regularly (several times a week) at this point. Do not skip these meetings.

We will ask for per-team-member contributions in the report, that everyone agrees to. The table should have specifics ("implemented X algorithm, see Section X for description and alg.py in code", "tuned hyper-parameters, see Section Y of report for procedure and results", "identified overfitting and added regularization (see reg.py) and showed a comparison with and without it (see Section Z)", etc.) Every team member must meaningfully contribute in terms of the natural language processing implementation and/or experimentation. Members cannot just, for example, help with writing the report at the end and that's it. Further, if it is determined that you did not meaningfully contribute, this will impact your grade.

Make sure that you have concrete task(s) to accomplish which, if completed, you would be proud of and can talk about in the report and contributions table.

As always, let us know if you have any project related questions.
