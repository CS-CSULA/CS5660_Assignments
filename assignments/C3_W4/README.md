## Lab

- Creating a Siamese Model using Trax

  Trax allows to define neural network architectures by stacking layers (similarly to other libraries such as Keras).  In this ungraded lab you will see how a Siamese model can be created using Trax.
  
- Modified Triplet Loss

  In this notebook you'll see how to calculate the full triplet loss, step by step, including the mean negative and the closest negative. You'll also calculate the matrix of similarity scores.

- Evaluate a Siamese Model

  In this lecture notebook you will learn how to evaluate a Siamese model using the accuracy metric using data from this week's assignment.
