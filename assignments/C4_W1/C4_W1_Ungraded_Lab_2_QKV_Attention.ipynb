    "# Scaled Dot-Product Attention: Ungraded Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2017 paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) introduced the Transformer model and scaled dot-product attention, sometimes also called QKV (**Q**ueries, **K**eys, **V**alues) attention. Since then, Transformers have come to dominate large-scale natural language applications. Scaled dot-product attention can be used to improve seq2seq models as well. In this ungraded lab, you'll implement a simplified version of scaled dot-product attention and replicate word alignment between English and French, as shown in [Bhadanau, et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer model learns how to align words in different languages. You won't be training any weights here, so instead I've prepared some [pre-trained aligned word embeddings from here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/aligned-vectors.html). Run the cell below to load the embeddings and set up the rest of the notebook."
