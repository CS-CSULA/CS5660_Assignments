    "# Assignment 1: Neural Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of Course 4. Here, you will build an English-to-Portuguese neural machine translation (NMT) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention. Machine translation is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful not only for translating one language to another but also for word sense disambiguation (e.g. determining whether the word \"bank\" refers to the financial bank, or the land alongside a river). Implementing this using just a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTMs can work for short to medium length sentences but can result in vanishing gradients for very long sequences. To help with this, you will be adding an attention mechanism to allow the decoder to access all relevant parts of the input sentence regardless of its length. By completing this assignment, you will:\n",

    "The model you will build uses an encoder-decoder architecture. This Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) takes in a tokenized version of a sentence in its encoder, then passes it on to the decoder for translation. As mentioned in the lectures, just using a a regular sequence-to-sequence model with LSTMs will work effectively for short to medium sentences but will start to degrade for longer ones. You can picture it like the figure below where all of the context of the input sentence is compressed into one vector that is passed into the decoder block. You can see how this will be an issue for very long sentences (e.g. 100 tokens or more) because the context of the first parts of the input will have very little effect on the final vector passed to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/plain_rnn.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an attention layer to this model avoids this problem by giving the decoder access to all parts of the input sentence. To illustrate, let's just use a 4-word input sentence as shown below. Remember that a hidden state is produced at each timestep of the encoder (represented by the orange rectangles). These are all passed to the attention layer and each are given a score given the current activation (i.e. hidden state) of the decoder. For instance, let's consider the figure below where the first prediction \"como\" is already made. To produce the next prediction, the attention layer will first receive all the encoder hidden states (i.e. orange rectangles) as well as the decoder hidden state when producing the word \"como\" (i.e. first green rectangle). Given this information, it will score each of the encoder hidden states to know which one the decoder should focus on to produce the next word. As a result of training, the model might have learned that it should align to the second encoder hidden state and subsequently assigns a high probability to the word \"você\". If we are using greedy decoding, we will output the said word as the next symbol, then restart the process to produce the next word until we reach an end-of-sentence prediction.\n",

    "You will dive deeper into this equation in the next week but for now, you can think of it as computing scores using queries (Q) and keys (K), followed by a multiplication of values (V) to get a context vector at a particular timestep of the decoder. This context vector is fed to the decoder RNN to get a set of probabilities for the next predicted word. The division by square root of the keys dimensionality ($\\sqrt{d_k}$) is for improving model performance and you'll also learn more about it next week. For our machine translation application, the encoder activations (i.e. encoder hidden states) will be the keys and values, while the decoder activations (i.e. decoder hidden states) will be the queries.\n",

    "  \n",
    "+ Pre-attention [LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM). Unlike in the encoder in which you used a Bidirectional LSTM, here you will use a vanilla LSTM. Don't forget to set the appropriate number of units and make sure that the LSTM returns the full sequence and not only the last output, which can be done by using the appropriate value for the `return_sequences` parameter. It is very important that this layer returns the state since this will be needed for inference so make sure to set the `return_state` parameter accordingly. Notice that LSTM layers return state as a tuple of two tensors called `memory_state` and `carry_state`, **however these names have been changed to better reflect what you have seen in the lectures to `hidden_state` and `cell_state` respectively**.\n",

    "- Finally a [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layer. This one should have the same number of units as the size of the vocabulary since you expect it to compute the logits for every possible word in the vocabulary.
